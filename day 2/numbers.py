# There are three types under numbers data-type.
# Integer
# Float
# Complex Number

a = 12
b = -33
c = 0b1010  # Binary number
d = 0o127  # Octal number
e = 0xAF12  # Hexadecimal number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# These are the integer types

a = 12.0
b = 2.12
c = -3.2
d = 2e2

# These are example of float types


a = 1+2j
b = 2-3j
c = 4j
# These are the examples of complex type
