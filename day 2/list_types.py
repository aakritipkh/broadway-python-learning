# Python lists are mutable objects
# We can create a list by enclosing a sequence in big brackets []

# We can also create a list using list() built-in function

a = []  # An empty list
b = list()  # An empty list using list() function

a = [1, 2, 3]  # Non-empty list
# In this list, all data are of integer data type, But list can also have heterogeneous type

a = [1, "Hello", 2.1, {1, 2, 3}, {"a": 1, "b": 2}]
# In this list, the data are of different types which is also supported by a python list

# We can use built-in type function to check the type of object
type([1, 2, 3])  # list
type((1, 2, 3))  # tuple
type(1)  # int
# and so on..
