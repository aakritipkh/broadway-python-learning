# There may be different projects in your system with different requirement of packages
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
# So to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment

# Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages in isolated form

# Important Commands
1. python -m venv <name_of_the_environment(venv)>
            = Creates a new virtual environment

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows device)
    source venv/bin/activate (for mac devices)
3. deactivate
    ==> It deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip install <package_name>
    ==> It installs te package to the environment
5. pip freeze
    ==> It shows all the installed packages in the environment
